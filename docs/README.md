## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone this repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahmudumar/thought_book.git
   cd Thought_Book
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Required: `customtkinter`, `pyinstaller`, `pywin32`

3. **Deploy the app**
   Run the deployment script:

   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```

   This will:

   * Bundle the app into a standalone `.exe` (via PyInstaller).
   * Create a Desktop shortcut (`NotesApp.lnk`) with a hotkey (default: `Ctrl+Alt+T`).

4. **Launch the app**

   * Use the Desktop shortcut
   * Or run directly from `dist\Thought Book.exe`.

## 🔑 First-time Setup

* On first launch, you’ll be asked to **create a password**.
* You’ll also be prompted to set a **recovery code** (write it down somewhere safe!).
* Notes are stored in `BMTbnotes.db` and the contents are protected with a light substitution cipher.

## ⚠️ Notes

* Tested on **Windows only** (due to shortcut + hotkey support).
* If you rerun `deploy.py`, it cleans old builds and generates a fresh `.exe`.
* Default hotkey can be changed in `deploy.py`.
* The `BMTbnotes.db` database is universally stored in your system's appdata folder in `roaming` folder (try pressing Windows + R and then typing `appdata`)
* For tips on how to backup your notes, [read the docs](./docs/how_to.md)
